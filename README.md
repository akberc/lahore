Lahore Web Framework
--------------------

Multi-site and Plugin-enabled Web Framework in Ceylon

Combining concepts from Play, Drupal, Ruby Liquid and best practices

Writen in the intuitive, type-safe and productive Ceylon programming language.

### Pre-Alpha software. If you still want to experiment, here are the steps to build and run:
* Install and/or build the [Ceylon distribution](http://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-dist)
 * Make sure the `ceylon` executable is in your PATH
 * Copy the *contents* of the `repo` folder in the Ceylon distribution to ~/.ceylon/repo (where ~ is the user's home directory)

* Choose a clean directory, clone the Lahore repository and build with `ant clean publish`

* Run with `ceylon run com.dgwave.lahore.core/0.1`
